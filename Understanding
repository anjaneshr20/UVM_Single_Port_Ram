Understanding of basics about Single Port Ram

The size of the RAM is determined by the number of addressable locations and the width of each data word. In this case, the parameters provided are:

ADDR_WIDTH = 16 bits

DATA_WIDTH = 8 bits

The ADDR_WIDTH specifies that the address bus is 16 bits wide, which means we can address 
2^16 locations.

2^16=65,536 locations.

The DATA_WIDTH specifies that each location stores 8 bits (1 byte) of data.

Now, to find the total size of the RAM in kilobytes (KB):

Size=Number of locations×Data width=65,536×1 byte=65,536 bytes
Since 1 kilobyte (KB) = 1024 bytes, we convert the size in bytes to kilobytes:

65,536 bytes=65,536÷1024 KB=64 KB
So, the RAM is 64 KB in size.
